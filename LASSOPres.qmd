## Introduction

-   We have previously discussed continuous outcomes and the appropriate distributions.

    -   Normal

    -   Gamma

-   We also discussed logistic regression models for binary, ordinal, and multinomial data.

-   We will now discuss regression models for count data:

    -   Poisson

    -   Negative binomial

-   We will also discuss the need for zero-inflation models.
